# 🎰 Anki Slot Machine

> Warning
> This add-on is still in testing.

Turn your suffering into fake money.

This add-on adds a completely unnecessary, slightly addictive, and emotionally manipulative slot machine on top of Anki.

It does **not** improve your memory.  
It does **not** change scheduling, intervals, cards, or notes.  
It **does** make you want to press "Good" just one more time.

## 🧠 What is this?

Every review becomes a gamble.

- You answer your card
- The slot resolves
- You win fake money, win nothing, or lose `$1`
- You feel something

That’s it. That’s the product.

## 💸 Rules (very serious business)

- **Again** → you lose `$1`  
  → skill issue

- **Hard** → you earn `$0`  
  → safe, boring, respectable

- **Good** → you spin and earn `$1 × multiplier`  
  → now we’re talking

- **Easy** → you spin and earn `$2 × multiplier`  
  → risky confidence

- **No match** → `x0`  
  → pain

- **Exact pair** → derived pair multiplier  
  → small hope

- **Triple** → derived triple multiplier  
  → the machine acknowledges your existence

## 🎯 The Philosophy

Most spins give nothing.  
Some spins give something.  
Rare spins hit.

Like life. But compressed into 300ms.

---

## 🧮 How it works (for nerds)

- Each symbol has a probability based on `slot_faces`
- Pairs and triples are evaluated from a real 3-reel result
- Rarer symbols scale higher than common ones
- Everything is tuned to hit a target expected value

Important:

Rare events are not there to make money.  
They are there to make you feel alive.

## 🧪 Tuning knobs

- `rarity_exponent` → how unfair life is
